It may be that you can do math better than me, but it's not the math that's the problem, it's statements like ""I don't know a whole lot about this case, but I tend to think that race may well be relevant here"" and ""My first instinct is it likely should be included as the news accounts likely included the information. But did they or was this simply not an issue?"". I assume you are ""counting"" those as ""in favour of inclusion""really, one can't. They are not unequivocal inclusion votes and raise more questions than they answer. Moreover, I assume you're including comments like ""I agree that race should be included as long as it does not violate WP:UNDUE.""

I am 100% positive the quote from the Brock article on Anita Hill in the magazine is ""a bit nutty, and a bit slutty"" (actual quote is: ""So Hill may be a bit nutty, and a bit slutty, but is she an outright liar?"") because I checked it in the original magazine article.  I believe the quote is the same in the Real Anita Hill book, but I do not have the book on hand to check so I will not argue that at at this time.

Why isn't re-writing a whole article just with a group of people who all agree with each other, with no clear notice to the public what is going on or where this draft is located, or how they can participate, even worse? This sure looks worse to me, like some sort of Tag Team situation, even if it isn't exactly canvassing. I don't see why it is okay for a group to plan to remove a whole article behind closed doors, while what he did is so egregious you wanted him blocked for three months.

The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.  The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D04 123 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.  The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 31 March 2010 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals  Late on 1st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..   On 14th April, the report was followed by the cancellation for the tender for a consultant to advise the Minister for Communications on the implementation of a Postcode in Ireland.

0	427527963.0	Instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.  	2011	False	article	blocked	train

0	65396433.0	" Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish ""Cross""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is ""Jewish"". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not ""ethnically"" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is ""Black"" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is ""Jewish"" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had ""Jewish mother"". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her ""Jewish"", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't ""ethnically"" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under ""some guy's website"". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.

Both of your positions are christian POV. Neutral POV here would be a secular one, and from that perspective, Islamic portraits by muslim scholars can be included.

In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.  What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.  To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in ""enforcing"" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your ""administrative"" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse.

It's about the TZM's advocacy of a RBE. There's a huge difference. Criticism sections should be about TGM and their views. Not about the larger issues they bring up. This is the same as any other page. For instance, a religious organization could have a ""criticism"" sections and include anything that might potentially fall under the broader discussions relating to religion (which could be a lot of things). Same thing goes for Further Reading. If there's a book or article dealing with TGM, then add them. Adding sources that just talk about RBE or broader social or economic issues is too broad.

0	326911391.0	"  == WIKIPEDIA IS ! ==  It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.  Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.  As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.  The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.  It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.  The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.  No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.  I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.

It is imperative that this page remain. -Alison Bibb   ==Notability of Ronald A. Carson== A tag has been placed on Ronald A. Carson requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.   If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.  :Please note that the above applies equally to Ronald a. carson.   |    For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.     ==License tagging for Image:Carson.pdf== Thanks for uploading Image:Carson.pdf.

There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish ""state"" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.

It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.  The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.

There's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems.

Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.  Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:- There are 13 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?  Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards).   :Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?  Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {ł}   ""Doesn't strike you?""  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.     :I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?  One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment.   ==Silas Simmons?==  :Who is Silas Simmons?  Silas Simmons was born Oct 14 1895, according to his WWI draft card:  Name: Silas Joseph Simmons  City: Philadelphia   County: Philadelphia   State: Pennsylvania   BirthPlace: Delaware   Birth Date: 14 Oct 1895   Race: African   Roll: 1907647   DraftBoard: 27    →  {ł}   http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml  Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.  He is not on the GRG list because the 1900 census lists him as born in '1897' (which would make him 'only' 108, instead of 110 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {ł}   :This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.

Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.

His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were ""innocent"".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, ""enemy combatants"".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were ""enemy combatants"".

A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.

I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).  I understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).    However, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?  I'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.  Thanks in advance for filling me in.     :Thanks for the help, Grutness (at   :   === Politician-stubs monitoring ===  Hi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.     :Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 200 stubs from 6 countries than 700 from 40 nations.

0	187679407.0	 ::::Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species. How's that for mentally inept and savagely hypocritical?	2008	True	article	blocked	test

It does not matter that the table ""has been there the longest"". If it doesn't comply with our policies and guidelines it needs to be fixed, not left in a non-compliant format. I am clearly not the only one complaining about the table. Numerous editors have attempted to change this and similar tables at various articles and you've reverted them without explanation. That's edit-warring, which can result in you being blocked from editing. There's even a Request for Comment open at WT:TV. However, even if I was the only one complaining, that's irrelevant. It just happens that I noticed the lack of compliance. Removing bolding from the table is simply not enough; the table needs to fully comply, which means incorporating row and column scopes, plainrowheaders, and fixing capitalisation problems as a minimum. There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being ""easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better"", the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons. The only visual differences are the capitalisation and column width fixes and better compliance with MOS:COLOR. From an editorial standpoint, the compliant table is much easier to read and update.

Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic?   The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church.   Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic.   Your mucking around lost a lot of changes, spelling corrections and other problems solved.

The objective was chosen as a place from which it would be possible to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation and to have dead ground, from which the artillery could begin a bombardment of the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 17th Division in corps reserve would pass beyond and advance through Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mameta and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank facing Fricourt and the wood, on the south rise of Willow Valley and the inner brigades of the 7th Division and 21st Division, were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander.  	2013	True	user	random	test

0	334372289.0	 : Could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article?  There are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science, as you know.     @Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are  * Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.   * Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly) * Theoretical model: Feedback  As to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article.   The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article.   The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.  The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.   	2009	True	article	blocked	train

I stand in shadow of the Almighty and your men who are like goats,sheep and deer could not harm me inspite of your deceptions.) 18)If I had deceived by taking oath on Holy Quran like the way you have done, I would not have bought my dear fighters to this position of disadvantage (by bringing them out of Anandgarh fort).

Further, a google turns up no evidence Joseph Zemskova as a manager or anything else. Maybe I missed something but I spotted no undisputed indicators that 1980 is her birth year.

0	640843240.0	  = Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis =  I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.  There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.  A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.  The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.  What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.  2015-01-03 Lena Synnerholm, Märsta, Sweden.	2015	False	article	random	train

I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would ""change the pages back until the end of time"" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from ""his"" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan).

Part of the reason for my ""offense"" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.  If I was just posting ""Hey! Come visit my site,"" without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people.   When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied.   Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime.   Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom, only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well..not being nice.

I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.  All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.  So, since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause, even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a 'white person' is, just do us all a favor and either delete this article (since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on), or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you, get over it, and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn't scientifically exist. /end commafest 2009	2009	False	article	random	train

0	18610514.0	"  -  I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.  I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a ""gut feeling"" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of ""pattern"" and bet based off of that, on the ""gut feeling"" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any ""patterns"" is purely coincidental.  "	2005	True	user	blocked	train

No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.  : As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.  : In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.

What you did is the fill-in-the-blank question: :::Gusuku ... often refers to castles or fortresses in ______ that feature stone walls. :: And your answer is ""the Ryukyu Islands."" That's wrong in the sense that we wouldn't say, ""We speak Germanic"" when we actually speak English. Castles or fortresses that feature stone walls are typical of Okinawa. Applying the term to other island groups is highly problematic to say the least. :: Narratives about gusuku are truly chaotic. No wonder you don't understand the situation correctly. No one can define the meaning of gusuku, which reminds me of family resemblance. What's why I avoided the ""A is B"" definition and used ""A often refers to B"" in the article. Explaining many conflicting theories as I did in the article is confusing. So I present just one hypothesis which I personally support: ::# The word gusuku originally meant stone walls that, say, partitioned agricultural fields. In other words, the word gusuku was not associated with castles. This meaning survives in Yaeyama. ::# There has been a long tradition of mountain cult. At first, the word gusuku was not associated with mountain cult. ::# In Amami, medieval mountain fortifications, that are typical of mainland Japan, were constructed, probably in response to Ryūkyū's repeated invasions. At this stage, the word gusuku was not associated with these mountain fortifications. ::# In Okinawa, some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls. One consequence of the fusion of mountain cult and fortification was the association of the word gusuku with mountain cult and/or fortification. The association of gusuku with stonework was weakened, but anyway Okinawa's castles and fortresses had stone walls. ::# Ryūkyū finally conquered Amami and introduced the noro ritual system to Amami. The new meanings of gusuku (1. related to mountain cult, 2. fortification) were also introduced to Amami. Most of the former medieval mountain fortifications were abandoned, but some were transformed into sacred places and given the name of gusuku even though they lacked stone walls. Some people of Amami might have interpreted the word gusuku as fortifications regardless of whether they had stone walls. Others reinterpreted the word as a sacred place regardless of whether it had stone walls. For this reason, some gusuku are on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves. ::# Archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture re-used the word gusuku as a technical term (yet another meaning). This was the source of confusion. They referred to Okinawa's castles and fortresses that feature stone walls as gusuku. They met fierce oppositions from folklorists because their use of gusuku was not grounded in people's actual usages. ::# Some archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture attempted to extend the gusuku-as-fortifications framework to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama, regardless of whether local people referred to the target as gusuku (The remains of human settlements of Yaeyama are not called gusuku by local people either). They met fierce oppositions not only from folklorists but also from fellow archaeologists. :: It is convenient to consider a dichotomy between inductive and deductive reasoning. Linguists, folklorists and ethnologists base their arguments on people's actual usages and try to infer a generalized conclusion from them. By contrast, archaeologists often define a term, independently of people's actual usages, and apply it to those which meet the definition. Due to lack of written materials, archaeologists need to name archaeological findings by themselves. So they naturally clash with scholars from other disciplines. :: It is important to note that the gusuku-as-fortifications framework (that's what the lead sentence says) is no longer supported in the archaeology of the Amami Islands. The renaming of so-called ""Uragami Gusuku"" was a symbolic event. A gusuku is a gusuku only because people refer to it as such. It's not because the referent meets some definition. In Amami, gusuku (as a technical term) is dead, long live gusuku (as to people's actual usages)!   "	2014	True	article	blocked	train

0	145404196.0	": Threatening Behavior?     This is an interesting question for the Wikipedia community: Does posting a link on a member’s Talk page to a YouTube video of yourself firing a weapon constitute threatening behavior?  Background: In the article about San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly, I have been debating BillyTFried about whether the article should include information about Daly’s support of a 2006 gun control ballot initiative, Proposition H. I said it shouldn’t because Daly was only one of four sponsors of the initiative, and the initiative wasn’t especially controversial in SF (it won with 58% of the vote). However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.  YouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted  along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)  Last night when I read his post, I thought it was just plain weird and creepy, but I didn’t feel threatened. This morning, however, I mentioned it to my wife, who was horrified. She pointed out that BillyTFried lives in the same town as me (he told me the cross streets where he lives) and that his post on my Talk page with the video link was made in the context of a gun control debate. She thought he was threatening me.  I did not take up this matter with BillyTFried because, frankly, after watching his video, I don't want anything to do with him. I’m just curious what the community thinks of this and whether some action should be taken against BillyTFried.   |- |}    {| class=""wikitable"" !align=""left""|Message To  From His Friend  |- |- bgcolor=""#F0F8FF"" |align=""left""|"	2007	True	user	blocked	train

Several people said they questioned the notability, and fwiw, one of the founder pages, Sage_Weil, was deleted. The sourcing of the article is significantly improved since I got involved, as looking at the edit history shows. Pro-company COI editing has long been a problem there.     (outdent) Was it appropriate in your opinion, for Sarek to relocate comments at the AfD?

0	255713869.0	"  == My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse ==  I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.  I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:  The admin  must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.  I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.  Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' ""solution"".  Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island.

It means that one out of every 136 devices will have a mechanical failure every year. Or, equivalently, if there were 1360 devices spinning, then on average, 10 would mechanically fail every year. That is the meaning of 1.2 million hours. But, this needs to be put into context. Infant mortality is not counted, because those devices never were in use. Software failures, user failures, infrastructure failures (brownouts), heat and overheating, and viral or deliberate attacks are not counted either. So, a home user is still going to see the failure every few years. Even with enterprise drives. What the home user should not see is driving the drive to death.

0	420588469.0	"  ==2D versus 3D Reconnection==  I'd just like to make a comment. This article does a fine job describing reconnection in 2D. The 3D generalization is not trivial though. In 3D sweet-parker or petcheck reconnection effectively becomes 3D null-point reconnection (without getting into quai-separatrix layers versus true separatricies). In addition, the application to the Magnetosphere is very different than the application to the solar corona, in that magnetospheric reconnection topologically requires a 4-flux system, whereas the solar corona requires only a 2-flux system.  Okay, I didn't realize how technical this article was going to be until I started writing it.  I'll make an effort to fill in some of the empty links, provide a diagram or three, and place links to this article on the relevant pages.  I'm currently conducting an experiment to study magnetic reconnection - if you have questions, post them here or on my talk page...  but be warned, I'll be at a conference for the next week, so my response may be slow.   I removed an anonymous edit that claimed magnetic reconnection occurs when the magnetic pressure exceeds the plasma pressure (ie when the plasma  parameter is less than unity).  This is not the case!  Magnetic reconnection (or the lack thereof) is related to the line-tying effect of high electrical conductivity, not to the magnetic pressure.    Zowie. While you are correct that reconnection occurs in both high and low beta plasmas, the process is local and does not depend on whether the system is line tied or not. Formally, magnetic reconnection is the tearing mode, of resistive MHD instability theory (see Furth, H.P., Killeen, J., and Rosenbluth, M. N., 1963, Phys. of Fluids, 6, 459). Several researches have shown line-tying the system simply slows the (linear) tearing mode growth rate (see Velli, M. and Hood, A. W., 1989, Sol Phys 119, 107; Velli, M., Einaudi, G., and Hood, A. W., 1990, ApJ, 350, 419).  —Preceding unsigned comment added by      ==Topology rather than current sheets==  I took the liberty of reducing the discussion of current sheets, which are not directly related to reconnection (they are in some sense a symptom of lack of magnetic reconnection!) and instead introduced separatrix surfaces and separators, the topological terms describing the domain boundaries.  (Note that separatrices, and magnetic reconnection, can exist in a vacuum, while current sheets cannot).    The discussion still needs considerable work, some work on the X-point figure (it would be nice to have the seapratrices and separator marked), an perhaps a 3-D figure to visualize domain topology  but I'm out of borrowed time for today.    Happy new year!      While it is true that topological separatricies exist independent of the plasma, reconnection cannot occur in vacuum. Reconnection absolutely requires a plasma, because it's the plasma that supports the dissipative current sheets that form along these separatricies.  ==Dissent about ""Magnetic Reconnection?""== Should notable peer-reviewed papers dissenting with the theory of magnetic reconnection be included in the article?  If so, Nobel prize winning plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén (the so-called ""Father of MHD"") has dissented in several articles (Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics, On frozen-in field lines and field-line reconnection), calling ""magnetic merging"" (""reconnection"") a pseudo-science. More recently, electrical engineer Don Scott has also published a dissenting paper (Real Properties of Electromagnetic Fields and Plasma in the Cosmos).     Of course not. That would be scientific heresy. This is about proping up failed theories and supporting misguided research.  To quote Alfvén: The conecepts 'frozen-in magnetic field lines' and 'field-line reconnection' play a certain role in discussions of the theory of the magnetosphere.  The use of these concepts has been criticized and we shall here demonstrate that both concepts are unnecessary and often misleading.

I have every right to use a word like that, it is not an insult but rather a title, and what really is the problem is someone's behavior and if someone is behaving a certain way I have every right to say something against it. I have heard MANY top scientologists use insults and what could be considered inappropriate behavior against people who are destructive or SPs or who behave badly, but it's ok, because minusing a negative equals a positive.  	2007	True	user	blocked	test

I would support a move to ""folk costume"" or ""folk dress"" for the reasons cited above, but ""folk costume"" should not be a subset of ""national dress"" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).  ::::[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!

Both ""costume"" and ""dress"" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  ""Clothing"" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing ""Medieval clothing"" vs. ""Medieval costume"" vs. ""Medieval dress"".  And ""folk clothing"" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, ""costume"" and ""dress"" are both preferred terms.  ::::OED definitions are pertinent here:  ::::*COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period. ::::*DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.  :::: is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.

0	439594198.0	"  == The Cramp Twins ==   The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).  Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003. Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year. The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.  The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka ""Tokyo Mew Mew"") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.  == Main characters == * Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is ""Girlpants"", but he sometimes calls Lucien a ""nerd"". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie.  * Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo	2011	False	article	blocked	dev

Detailed in the lawsuits www.disneylawsuit.com  filed in Federal court “PUBLIC RECORD” (2005 & 2006), and in various national and international news and press releases, state that in the early 1990's independent film maker Royce Mathew had pitched his original supernatural pirate story to the Walt Disney Company which is about “cursed pirates” of the Black Pearl pirate ship; pirates who don't want anything to do with the plunder/return a treasure because they are cursed, with effects of the curse they endure is fully revealed by moonlight and the gold medallion on a gold chain with mystic properties able to summon/call.  Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.  Then years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.    During legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company.	2008	False	article	blocked	test

The Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity.""  ""1971: To the Lord's Sermon on the Mount it is fitting to add the moral catechesis of the apostolic teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc. This doctrine hands on the Lord's teaching with the authority of the apostles, particularly in the presentation of the virtues that flow from faith in Christ and are animated by charity, the principal gift of the Holy Spirit. ""Let charity be genuine. . . . Love one another with brotherly affection. . . . Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.""29 This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of conscience in the light of our relationship to Christ and to the Church.""  ""1973: Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical counsels. The traditional distinction between God's commandments and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to charity, the perfection of Christian life. The precepts are intended to remove whatever is incompatible with charity. The aim of the counsels is to remove whatever might hinder the development of charity, even if it is not contrary to it.""  ""1975: According to Scripture the Law is a fatherly instruction by God which prescribes for man the ways that lead to the promised beatitude, and proscribes the ways of evil."""	2006	False	article	random	train

And here is what you wrote:  ""...Once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form the protein of interest (X) is often cleaved from MBP with a specific protease.

It would be great if you can explain how can ""Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again"" because I have tried it and it doesn't work. My personal guess is since MBP binds to maltose, it simply doesn't bind to amylose resins / column unless maltose is removed beforehand.  Then the question is how to remove maltose from MBP. From Davidson et al. Mechanism of maltose transport in Escherichia coli: Transmembrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins (1992:  ""Preparation of Maltose-Free MBP  MBP was purified by affinity chromatography and was dialyzed extensively under conditions calculated to remove most of the bound maltose. For some experiments, MBP was denatured in 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and either dialyzed against 6M Gdn-HCl or passed through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 6M Gdn-HCl before renaturation by dialysis against 10mM KP1 (pH 7.0).

0	141690879.0	Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.  I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.  In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.

The Naval Task Group for Operation VELA, a three month deployment to West Africa in 2006, was under the command of Commander UK Amphibious Group, Commodore Phil Jones. The VELA deployment involved a significant number of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, the Royal Marine Commandos and helicopters.[14] The Task Group included HMS Albion, HMS Ocean, HMS Southampton, HMS Argyll, RFA Wave Knight, RFA Mounts Bay, RFA Sir Bedivere, RFA Fort Austin, HMS Enterprise, RFA Diligence, RFA Oakleaf, Mine Counter Measure Squadron 1 and a Fleet submarine together with the Fleet Lead Commando Group, consisting of 40 Commando Royal Marines, 59 Commando Independent Engineering Squadron, 29 Commando Royal Artillery and 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines. Also involved were elements of Fleet Diving Unit 2 and 849 (B) Flight from RNAS Culdrose. Embarked in HMS Ocean for the deployment a Tailored Air Group (TAG) was formed, consisting of Sea King helicopters of 845 Naval Air Squadron, 846 Naval Air Squadron, Merlin Mk 1 aircraft from 820 Naval Air Squadron and Lynx helicopters of 847 Naval Air Squadron. The Vela task group conducted an amphibious exercise, Exercise Green Eagle, in Sierra Leone.  Task Groups despatched to the Far East since 2003 have included deployments in 2003, 2004, and 2005. In 2003, Naval Task Group 03 had been intended to take part in FPDA exercises in the Asia-Pacific region but was diverted for involvement in the 2003 Iraq War. Eventually part of the Naval Task Group including Liverpool, Marlborough and RFA Grey Rover departed Gulf waters, after the intervention phase of the Iraq War (2003), en route for Exercise Flying Fish, with Commonwealth-partners and members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements which are the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In 2004, Exeter, Echo, RFA Diligence and RFA Grey Rover visited the Asia-Pacific region. In 2005, Liverpool, with RFA Grey Rover, made such a deployment.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.  If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

0	81942236.0	"  The rise and development of the Haskalah, or Jewish enlightenment, was different in Western Europe and Eastern Europe. In the West, an attempt was made to strip Judaism of its national character, and label it merely a ""religion."" The motivation behind this was to defend recently acquired political rights; and in particular, the new idea that Jews were citizens of the European ""states"" in which they resided. In retrospect the giving of political rights to Western European Jewish residents was contingent on their ceasing to be Jews in the traditional sense; or in any sense at all. The “reform” movement, started in Germany, was an attempt to give religious imprimatur to these developments; including rejecting the re-establishment of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem; and thus naming synagogues “temples.” In the East, the Haskalah led to secular Jewish nationalism (e.g., Chaim Zhitlowsky's ideas); of which Zionism was just the most successful and consequential. However, even in the East, there were assimilationists who wanted to dissociate themselves from their heritage to gain approval of gentiles. The “Jew” that is the subject of antisemitism is an artificial construct of the Roman Catholic church; and has no connection to flesh and blood Jews. It was an attempt by Jews to distance themselves from the chimera of Christian theology that later morphed into racism, (invented to attack newly acquired Jewish political rights in Europe), that Jews were attempting, perhaps understandably, to distance themselves from. Even in America, there were references to “Hebrews” instead of “Jews”; in an effort to seek approbation from gentiles; and distance Jews from Christian mythology. (It should be noted that America’s, (i.e., the United States, but not Canada’s), offer of citizenship was genuine and not a quid pro quo.)

But you would have to be a little creative about naming her because there is already a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre and a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon, and this Agnes' birth and death date are unknown.   :Just doing that.  I'm going to clean up the entire list.   ::Just create a stub. Check Isabella of Urgel's article, it's as short as Agnes' article will be and she had a son who was king.   :::Thanks David.  You did a fantabulous job. You probably should change the first paragraph to show how her indentity is disputed and how the indentity of her father is disputed between William VI and William VII.   ::::I don't know. I wish he'll take it less seriously, I mean I can't put any dates that are historically guessed.  He and Srnec are the same.  He seem to only altered Agnes' page but Ermesinda's page seems pretty intact with a few arrangement changes. BTW have you checked any of my new lists, you can check some out at Category:Lists of countesses, Category:Lists of duchesses, Category:Lists of princesses, and Category:Lists of queens.   :::::I moved it. As for Majorca, it'll be finished after I added the independent queen consorts.  Do you think another page should be created for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy since Agnes, wife of Ramiro I of Aragon isn't really even on both Agnes?  Agricolae removed all the children of the Savoyard Agnes of Aquitaine.   ::::::Yeah I saw that connection of Bertha and Agnes, but we can't be sure if there were one or two Agnes.  We can just say how they may be the same person.   :::::::I don't really care anymore, he must have been easedropping into our conversation.  I hate arguing because in the end I always lose. One bad thing about me is that I'm a pushover.  Well List of Majorcan consorts is done, in time I'll create another section for the titular queen consorts and another section for the Ladies of Balaguer.     ::::::::Please give your opinion on Talk:Miguel da Paz, Prince of Asturias :::::::::Nice work on Agnes and Elisenda's page. My computer has been infected since Wednesday; I'm only replying via my Ipod.  I probably won't edit until tommorrow or the day after.  By the way congrats on Urraca's article.

Wikipedia states,   ""Wikipedia does not publish original research (OR) or original thought. This includes unpublished facts, arguments, speculation, and ideas; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position. This means that Wikipedia is not the place to publish your own opinions or experiences.""  One Night in Hackney states, ""Sources get things wrong and make mistakes. GOOD editors are capable of noticing when sources have made a mistake and compensate accordingly, BAD editors are not and make a mess of articles by blindingly adding incorrect information"" and adds later, ""I even proved Bell contradicted himself..."".  Clearly One Night in Hackney is conducting original research, as what he describes is ""original thought.""  He provided no citation to a source indicating that Bell was mistaken, only his own ""proof.""  Who is he, or I, or you, to unilateral make such an assessment  he might be right, but it's original research.  The Wikipedia pages also state, ""It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be civil and neutral, respecting all points of view, and only add verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions.""  One Night in Hackney has not been civil or neutral on this talk page or in responding to my edits.  I have added factual information, direct quotations, only to have them deleted.  When I attempted, in my last edits, to merge his point of view and mine, those edits were also deleted.

0	91296246.0	"(reset tab) I think it's important to define 'hatred' and 'hostility'. Many Christians and fundamentalists believe that it is their duty as part of their mission to bring Christianity to all non-believers. Whether the effects are positive or not, proselytizing is not hostility per se. The key ingredient is in the intention of the person doing it. Websters defines hostility as a ""deep-seated usually mutual ill will"" so an important ingredient is a very strong dislike towards a person or group. Warning people who (in your belief) are taking the wrong moral path does not qualify unless you insult them in the process, especially if you hold yourself to the same standard.

Your edit summary reads, ""the section here describes the missile, not just lists its characteristics. Standard way of naming sections on similar articles. Also, i would be happy to compare GRE scores"". You are making this oh so easy for me, but for your benefit I will simplify things by hypothetically replacing the missile with a person. If I were to describe a person - perhaps on a police report - what would it entail? Height, weight, hair and eye colour, age? Yes, but I may also go on to describe the persons observable behavior, actions and tone of voice etc, to the best of my ability. This is a fairly standard example of what would fit a description.   The articles original sub heading - Characteristics - encompasses a more diverse and flexible approach to the subject, for example distinctive features or a distinguishing quality unique to that particular missile (or person!). It goes more in-depth, a wider representation of the subject. However, as defining Characteristics are very descriptive in nature, it is easy and common these days to make mistakes, just as you have clearly made the mistake of getting muddled with the correct use of description and characteristics (as represent by your edit summary).  Difference between a description and a characteristic? Description: He is tall, 6ft 6. Characteristic: It is his height of 6ft 6 that distinguishes him.

Wise Use activists exploited the population’s fear of job and property security loss. The Campaign placed a barrier between workers and environmentalists. The Wide Use Campaign used bumper stickers, phone-ins and faxes to promote their views. Wise Use and Republicans kicked off anti-environmentalism. The recession that began in 1990 enhanced anti-green and pro-industry views. A group called Alliance for America was created with 125 anti-environment and pro-industry groups. In 1994, the US did not pass a Biodiversity Treaty.  Another group that was created in the 90’s was called Earth Day Alternatives. They were also counter-environmentalists. This group labelled environmentalists as “anti-human” and extremists.  The Earth Day Alternative group promoted three things. They aimed to privatise resources for exploitation, advocate pollution to be permitted as trade between companies, to discredit environmental science. Heritage was a group that was also created with a laissez-faire approach toward the environment.  Anti-environmentalists were motivated by the fact that the ICI created deceptive green advertising.     	2012	True	article	random	train

0	104304761.0	"   1. Gene_poole, it is not MY pet project - as stated clearly more than once above. That's one more proof you don't read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don't check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I'm not convinced you can give any actual evidence there's an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn't even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my ""little rant"" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my ""various pronouncements"" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn't it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here. After that, it is up to you, to show whether justice really exists in Wikipedia or it is really subject to control by self-authorised junkies as my impression has always told me.  2. I understand the rules of Wikipedia and its standards for verifiability. But I can name you at least a dozen Wiki entries which don't have verifiable source either, save some crafted websites linked to them (that's not a reliable source, anyone can put up a website about anything) - and they still remain. Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was ""made up in school in one day"" by reading ""my webpage"". And, aren't most other invented utopian micronations created in exactly the same circumstances? Isn't this exactly what it's all about? It's not about existing micronations.  3. ""Wikipedia places a high value on verifiable reliable sources"" - that's pretty ridiculous, as far as anyone's invented micronation is concerned. Invented projects like this do not exist - that's the main idea of utopia. What a material proof do you require? This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it. My only conclusion: it made you jealous, and abusing the powers that Wikipedia gives you, you did not hesitate for a minute to do what you've always done (yes, I've been following your epics over here for some time).  4. ""Do you have press coverage, books, real-world items proving it's been an active, well known project?"" - if you had made the smallest of researches, you'd have found out that this project has participated on a number of exhibitions (the latest one, in Germany) and has picked up some awards among other such invented micronation projects. As for real-world items, the only ones for now are postal stamps issued in recent years - that's something I doubt most of the projects on this list can pride of.  In conclusion, I think this discussion remains pointless until the moment when I provide the above ""proofs and evidence"" requested. Then, I'll be looking forward to your response.  As for the statement about Wikipedia pronounced in the above Letter, I believe things will change some day here too, though this looks rather unlikely at present. One day, guys like you will be stripped off their undeserved powers. Because the idea behind Wikipedia is too utopian itself - complete freedom brings anarchy. But I admire its democratic principle - everyone has equal rights to express their opinions without being deleted or edited by someone else to whom they don't sound suitable. As for the Truth, the Facts (what is ""notable"" enough), the Truth is only what the more powerful present it to be.  "	2007	True	article	random	train

0	36322408.0	"  == Trivia lesson  ==  Ok, I’m going to enjoy this… Here we go, amateur. You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:  1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like ""Boss"" and ""roman"" , now? heh, heh, heh)  Reply:   2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.  Reply:   3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my ""mate"". Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…  Reply:   4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the ""Roman"" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.  Reply:  5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong  Reply:  6. I put the first Clayface after mentioning that the previous are important. Don't make me doubt of your reading skills. How ever Basil Karlo has been important on and off and he started the Clayface concept and we have to point that. You talked about context to me, marking the appearance of the 1st Clayface, as I did, is context.   Reply:  7. I could doubt words I used like hot, sexy, bimbo and many other, that I once and again asked everyone to edit if they don't happen to like them. But I think is safe to say their creators intentions were to make those female characters look like that. Didn't you notice the curves in the drawings? I dunno about you but for most guys that could be a hot bimbo. In both comics and series Harley has been portrayed as a slut, sleeping with her teachers for a better note, killing his lover without caring and even was hinted as a playful lesbian in Hush.

All the news stories I saw said that Vajpayee resigned immediately and his resignation was accepted by the president. This is not possible.-    He did in fact resign, and the president did accept it. However, as is custom, the president asked him to ""continue in office til alternative arrangements are made"". (The Hindu) http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200405140111.htm    Was Manmohan Singh sworn-in on the 19th, or did he merely become the 'designate'? I have not seen anything saying he IS now PM.    : How about this? The article quite unequivocally states that Abdul Kalam appointed Singh PM. Is it a technical point that he is PM only after he's been sworn in?  |    :: To summarise the entire process, once the election results in India are declared, the President has the prerogative to invite any person (by convention - the elected leader of the single largest party/coalition. Note again - the chosen leader of the party does not have to be a member of the parliament, as yet.) to form the government. Please note that invitation is not equal to appointment. If it is clear that the ruling party is getting the boot, the Prime Minister formally submits his resignation to the President, who advises him to stay in power until alternate arrangements are made. Technically, the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered. In case of disputed numbers, the elected government must prove its majority on the parliament hall by tabling a confidence motion, within a stipulated period. And if the leader is unelected, he/she is required to get elected from either houses of parliament within six months.  :: The case of the Parliament is a little more curious. The parliament is born on the day of its first session, when the individual members are sworn in. So technically, as on date, India has a government without a parliament. It would continue to remain so, until June 2, when the monsoon session convenes.    ::: Thanks, , for the clarification.  |    ==First non-Hindu?== The article currently states that Manmohan Singh is the first non-Hindu to be PM. I know that a number of newspaper articles have been repeating this, but I think it's wrong (or at least disputable) in that Rajiv Gandhi was a Parsee. At any rate, his father Feroze Gandhi was half-Muslim and half-Parsee, and if I'm not mistaken Zoroastrianism was the religion passed down to Rajiv and Sanjay (not that anybody in the family is exactly religious!).    == Guest Book on website of PM India ==  Guest Book on website of  *http://www.pmindia.nic.in is not working for last two years.

Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume ""Good Faith"" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume ""good faith"" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process. I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it. I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment. Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not ""assuming good faith"" or ""positively contributing to the consensus"". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for ""Making a point instead of wanting to edit"". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the ""TALK"" page says no writing will be allowed that involves ""general discussion"" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts.

Ample sources exist and the WP infoboxes show the official L/M (or M/L) credit. * Who actually wrote the song is pretty easy to determine for most of the songs where there is no dispute between L and M. Using various interviews and biographies as sources, L and M say what their part was. For a small minority of songs, such as ""Eleanor Rigby"", L and M disagreed and the article describes the disputed authorship. For cases where there was a 60/40 split, adverbs like ""predominantly"" or ""mainly"" make sense, but not in cases where there is no dispute that L or M was the sole author. * While it is true that the lead singer was often the main writer of an L/M song, it is not always true. ""Every Little Thing"" is one such exception. * Other people who contribute to a song—such as a producer or soloist—typically do not get a writing credit for their contribution. That's standard practice in the industry with rare exceptions, and there are good reasons for it. When someone makes a significant contribution, that should be discussed in the prose or in the Personnel section, i.e., ""Martin wrote the string arrangement"" or whatever.  Your position on the L/M situation is a minority viewpoint. The authorship details you are challenging are typical of hundreds of articles that have similar prose and use similar evidence and the text in those articles have been accepted by many WP editors.

It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for ""synthesis"".     ::I don't think anyone is looking for ""loopholes"". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.    :::There is nothing ""slavish"" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.     :::: I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.    :::As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically ""no consensus at all"".  Cheers.    ::::Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.    :::::The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines ""Christian terrorism"" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term ""Christian religious terrorism"" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression ""Christian terrorism"" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about ""religious communal terrorism"" carried out by Christians, or ""nationalist terrorism"" between different religious groups. :::::Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC? :::::   ::::::I'm so tempted to just reply ""yes"". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of ""Christian terrorism"" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word ""genocide"" instead of the word ""terrorism"". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link.

Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.  There are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it's up to you and it's immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.  You and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.  I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic ""learn to breed"" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.  What Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it's very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake.

0	28503522.0	"  ==Bias== I was about to remove the last 5 paragraphs of the section ""2005"" and replace it with the paragraph by Mark83 in his last edit. Those paragraphs look more than a little biased, and what's more, some facts are inaccurate, as well. But then, looking at other parts of the article, I find that it has been modified in other places too, recently, and the writing style makes it look like something written by a fan. So I haven't deleted the last paragraphs as I was about to, and am instead awaiting a discussion on the whole article.  Below are factual inaccuracies (apart from the general bias) I've noticed in the last 5 paragraphs of the section ""2005.""  ""In comparison to Räikkönen, Alonso had made significantly fewer driving errors than his rival (just one in Canada) and has been a model of consistency finishing in the top three more times than Räikkönen.""  My memory isn't the best, but of the races in just the latter half, I distinctly remember Alonso making mistakes in qualifying in Hungary and Hockenheim. Raikkonen wasn't prone to many mistakes, either.  ""Alonso was not only the fastest driver in qualifying but also matched the McLaren MP4-20’s speed, running with relatively the same amounts of fuel on board.""  This is just speculation, isn't it? Since the Safety Car came on before the frontrunners had made their pitstops (not to forget Montoya retiring due to the drain cover incident), there is no way of verifying such a claim, other than believing press releases by the teams concerned, which are not exactly models of unbiased reporting - especially given that throughout most of the season, McLaren were shown to be qualifying with much more fuel on board than Renault.

(Nope, it's just that your vocabulary skills are astonishingly weak for a so-called journalist, I should have said.) The lesson I took (apart from the obvious one, that some real doofuses get to be in positions of power) was that people tend to assume differences where they don't necessarily exist.

His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment:   Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)     ::Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his ""views,"" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this ""view"" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.     == sumac opening sentence ==  I don't know what the right wording is, but do you see the problem with ""Sumac (also Rhus) is a genus of approximately 250 species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae""?

The interconnected nature of Wikipedia is its strength this needs to be changed! Your style of writing is too conversational for an informational article. Write as if you are the expert.   Little changes: Using Wiki markup to force a table of contents at the beginning could add structure to this article. This might help you better relate a topic to the next topic you're going to discuss. I would also suggest moving the image up to the top of the article, so you can immediately communicate visually with the reader.  Style suggestions: It needs some spell check; read it out loud to catch them if your word processor didn't. It could also use some grammatical editing to avoid embarrassing apostrophes dropping in wherever they like.   Visual suggestions: The figure is well-made (that is, it gets across the process of producing a river anticline) but it is not properly tagged according to wiki's copyright protocols and it could stand some labeling and uploading in a higher resolution.  Overall, you have a good start. Adding links to other articles and presenting the most professional article you can will help you get the rest of the way there.

My point is that when you say ""all types of Judaism"", Orthodox Jews do not view Conservative Judaism as being any different than Christianity or Islam with regards to validity. I fail to see the difference between simply making a page titled ""Religion of Monotheism"" which includes Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Reformed Judaism, Conservative Judaism etc... Just like Judaism and Christianity do not share a same page, so too Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism should not share the same page as they are two completely separate religions.

One who made it through was James Thompson  whom was an Olympic Alternate 4 or 5 times and 6 time medalist in the National Championships while also being the subject of independent articles   .  Even there, they kept saying he didn't pass manote, when he obviously passed GNG.  I don't believe that the group of individuals were looking at WP:BEFORE where it stated ""D. Search for additional sources, if the main concern is notability The minimum search expected is a Google Books search and a Google News archive search; Google Scholar is suggested for academic subjects.

Sammy Davis, Jr. was invited to accept an honorary membership in the Church of Satan by Michael Aquino. After Davis sent Aquino his acceptance on March 17, 1973, he was presented with the honorary membership on April 13, 1973 by Aquino and Karla LaVey alone. ASL did not meet Davis until August 1973. Davis would later renounce Satanism, claiming later he was ""only into it for the chicks"" and re-embraced Judaism. At a nationaly televised event honoring him a few weeks before he died, Davis said ""First of all, I want to thank Jesus for letting me be here tonight"", completely shattering any doubt he had any lingering affinty to Satanism. Davis had been an activist for civil rights, and battled racism, in contrast to the racists and Neo-nazis that often embrace Satanism.

He then struck out a solo career and moved to ashfield community radio where he had three different shows over 2 years.  These were 'Saturday sport' which broadcast saturdays 5pm-7pm, 'LIVE MID MORNING SATURDAY/SUNHDAY' (depened which day it was) between 9am and 12 midday.  Finaly he teamed up with nina squires to do the 'Super Sports Saturday Show' between 2pm and 6pm.  He then left ashfield comunity radio in late 2005 to move to 'Regency FM' which broadcast on the internet.  There he ran a show on saturday mornings 10am-1pm 'The Saturday Revolution Show',  Which grew a cult following across north east derbyshire and bangor in Wales.  Then sadly Regency Radio closed down due to lack of funds.

0	37187261.0	" (UTC)  This debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. The consensus definition of fact is ""something that can be demonstrated to be true"", in other words, ""something based on empirical evidence"". I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition ""fact"", that is, they would not claim that their views are ""built on empirical evidence"". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user. The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect. If anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact, go right on ahead.   07:41, 29 January 2006"	2006	True	article	random	test

0	330425841.0	"    ===____===  Well all right, at least we are getting some debate on the subject.  Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a ""revolutionary design"" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial ""flat turret"" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped ""hexagonal turret"" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.  As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.    Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.    ____  DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text ""awful"", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:  1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie ""Alexander Nevsky"", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.  2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.  But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.

""Commonsensual"" is not OR. Occupation sensu stricto is something quite concrete, and it is regulated by various international conventions. For instance, Guggenheim lists three different forms of occupation, and one of them refers to something quite unique. Therefore, we can speak about the ""occupation sensu stricto"" and ""occupation following an armistice"". That is what I mean under ""commonsensual"" occupation, and that is how a reader will understand it. ::::Re belligerent occupation, I do not deny the fact that some sources do describe it in this way; however, other sources (majority of sources) use different terminology. Therefore, the reference to one more source that uses the terminology you like does not change a picture much. I propose to present both viewpoints - you reject the very opportunity that a second viewpoint exists. Therefore, it is your arguments that do not hold water. ::::Re Malksoo, please, re-read his works again. And, since both you and I can draw different conclusions from different pieces of Malksoo's text, below is a quote from his own explanation of his own position, made specifically for us: :::::"" The Baltic Sattes were occupied in June 1940 and annexed (incorporated) by the USSR in August 1940. Thus, both occupation and annexation DID happen. The fact of annexation - and that the USSR proceeded with its policies from the presumption that these territories were its own, not occupied - changed the nature of the occupation, if not in terms of law than at least in terms of political realities. For example, when 1980 Moscow olympic games took place, the olympic regatta took place in Tallinn. This cannot be a typical occupation situation. :::::However, it is important that the article would make clear that in the eyes of the predominant Western opinion and post-1991 restored Baltic States themselves, the Soviet annexation remained illegal. In this sense, illegal annexation equals extended occupation and the whole debate is a pseudo-debate. The annexation - since it remained illegal - did not create any extra rights to the annexing power, the USSR. If the article makes that aspect clear, I would be perfectly fine with the title of the article being changed to ""Occupation and Annexation of the Baltic States"". In fact, I would recommend such change because it takes more precisely (closer to the facts) into account the complex nature of the Soviet rule in the Baltic States."" ::::What else do you need? Malksoo clearly says that in the case of the Baltic states both occupation and annexation took place, and we can speak about continued occupation in this sense (but not in others. P.S.) llegal annexation equals extended occupation. In other words, we can speak about occupation in a context of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and I never argued against that. Again, what synthesis you accuse me in? ::::Re ""there is no bridge between the Baltic and Soviet/official Russian positions; there is no in-between or continuum of scholarship, it's one or the other;"" Wrong. There is a Baltic position, position of different foreign states (which was different from state to state and from time to time), positions of scholars (western, Baltic, Russian), Soviet positions (different during 1950s-70s and during Perestroika) and official Russian position. ::::Re ""From Glantz to Malksoo, a belligerent occupation."" Glantz is an authoritative expert in the military aspects of the WWII, not in the legal aspects; Malskoo does not consider Soviet intervention in 1940 as a military operation at all. The only aggressive step, according to him, was a naval blockade. ::::Re ""Baltic citizens became a lower class as their homelands were ""colonized"""" Probably. However, other sources tell that the real economic and political situation in these republics were much better than in other parts of the USSR, hence extensive influx of migrants. Was it possible if they had a colonial status? ::::I expect you to treat my arguments seriously.  "	2011	True	article	random	train

Mr. Sogavare said ""certain elements"" of the local police force have succumbed to agendas of the occupying force."" How can it be Aussie-bashing to describe Sogavere's words accurately? It is no secret that Sogavere did not want RAMSI in Solomon Islands or that he was not on good terms with the Australian government; to describe his statement that ""the occupying force"" had a ""desire to control"" meant that he accused both RAMSI and the local police of a desire to control is simply to misrepresent the contents of the news item. No doubt Sogavere is guilty of Aussie-bashing; those who quote him without editorialising are certainly not guilty of it.

Stating that ""it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.  With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.  First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.  So here we begin...  Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck ""junk in a trunk"" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.  Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself.  Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)  ""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""  All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this ""scene"" stuff.   It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about ""I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""  Understand what I am pointing out?  Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly.  So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this ""Emo label"" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •     :Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.  :If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.    ::And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic.

I felt this was necessary so that readers could be adequately introduced to and informed of the distinctly different forms of feminism.  The descriptions include a list of people who would be considered important figures within each movement, and any suggestions to alterations or additions to those lists are appreciated.     I also removed some information from the article, which talked about egalitarian and protectionist feminism.  While these are terms that should be explored somewhere, they may not be needed in this initial discussion of the different forms of feminism.  This section seems to tell more about ideological splits mostly within liberal feminism, and does little to display the depth of ideas and tactics that make up feminism as a whole.  The page also only discussed radical feminism in relation to separatist movements, which is only displaying the most extreme part of radical feminist ideology while ignoring anything else that the movement may have to say.  The last part that I removed talked about feminist-sympathetic men’s groups.  I feel like this is something that should be addressed elsewhere, looking at these groups and the ways in which men are placed when they try to be a part of the feminist movement.   This page could definitely use some embellishment, concerning feminist theory and the works of some of these influential people, but I felt that there needed to be a basic description of the most common fields of feminism before the page could be improved upon.    	2007	True	article	random	train

Only a simple question as to what motivates you to defame other users.  :Here are the examples that I have compiled since being introduced to this issue. We have  who complains about your harassment on this talk page above. “I have not attacked you. Actually, quite the reverse. I have not exercized censorship. Quite the reverse.

Dear Administrators: ""I would like to file a complaint against user ""nescio"" for wanton vandalism of the article entitled ""Police State"". User Nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e.g. historical police state examples "" Chile under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet"" and ""Argentina under the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional"", as well as other examples . This childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, which is detrimental to Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy. I have tried to reason with this user, but it is unfortunately to no avail. Regretfully , I have no choice but to request that this user be blocked from editing at this time.  Sincerely yours, User Winston Smith   describes you as “the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia” while encouraging you to “Please stop this childish behavior.”   had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.     is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.     It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against WP:NPOV policy.

Removed the ""natural alternatives"" or actually added a question mark. Added refs to show that these ""alternatives"" do not work. Also removed various distinctions between ""natural"" and ""synthetic"". There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.    Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.     What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.    Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.    As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.   :Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET.

0	167663548.0	"===Canada===  In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to: *place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions; *encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and *maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support.  This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.  ====Bruker v. Marcovitz====  The justiciability of a civil contract with religious overtonese is now being tested in the Supreme Court Case of Bruker v. Marcovitz. See Canadian Civil Liberties Association. http://www.ccla.org/pos/legal/  In 1969, the parties married in an orthodox ceremony.  During the next 11 years they adopted two children after Ms. Bruker was unable to conceive.  In April of 1980, Ms. Bruker initiated divorce proceedings.   A link to the decision database is http://www.jugements.qc.ca/ and the full decision can be found with a text search for “Bruker” under “Cour d’appel”  In 1980, Mr. Marcovitz agreed upon a consent judgment for the divorce to appear immediately before Rabbinical authorities for the purpose of granting the religious Get.  Shortly, after the civil divorce, Ms Bruker, personally and through various attorneys and Rabbis, asked Mr. Marcovitz to provide the get, but Mr. Marcovitz refused. Mr. Marcovitz opined that he refused to comply because he viewed Ms. Bruker's behavior since the divorce as harassment and an attempt by her to alienate him from his children.    Ms Bruker sued Mr. Marcovitz in 1989, seeking damages in the amount of $500,000 ""for having been restrained from going on with her life since de Decree Nisi [...], for having been restrained to remarry according to the Jewish faith [and] for having been restricted of having children"".  Marcovitz vs. Bruker (500-09-013353-032; September 20, 2005)  In 1995, a certificate of divorce was issued by the Rabbinical Court of Montreal with Mr. Marcovitz's consent and participation to the get.  Despite receiving the get, Ms Bruker amended her action to increase the amount of the damages claimed to $1,350,000 and to include damages ""for the loss of consortium.""   Since Mr. Marcovitz was in breach of a judgment of the civil court, the lower court found that the matter could be argued before the civil courts and that Mr. Marcovitz had breached his contractual obligation to ""appear before Rabbinical Authorities.  He awarded Ms. Bruker $47, 500 in damages.  On appeal, Justice Hilton, writing for the three member court, overturned the lower court judgement.  The appellate court ruled that the obligation was religious in nature and so could not be judged by the civil courts.   ""It matters not that the obligation was stated in the Consent that the Superior Court ratified, since the Superior Court could never have entertained an application for corollary relief under section 17 of the Divorce Act to require the issuance of a ghet. It is not at all unusual to see the parties in an agreement on corollary relief undertake to perform a variety of obligations that are not, strictly speaking, obtainable independently, but which are desirable nevertheless to the extent that they promote an amicable post-divorce environment.""   ""While I recognize the usefulness of the inclusion of obligations of this nature in divorce agreements, it does not follow that they all automatically become subject to curial supervision and control, whether for specific performance or damages in the event of a breach. In my view, in order for such clauses to be enforceable, they must be directly related to one of the subje	2007	True	user	blocked	train

Stop lying, stop accusing people of sockpuppetry who seem continents apart, stop hiding exactly those tracks about you that you accuse others of. You get yourself into a shambles, credibility wise. Anyhow, what business of yours is it what people without remotest relation to you do on wikipedia? You seem drunk, on drugs and having your period ??? 	2006	False	user	blocked	dev

1	181167991.0	 :::Neither of those is a personal attack. The first you refer to, I repeat exactly what is said above, calling the person a VANDAL, which is exactly what they are. I'd say you are launching personal attacks upon me by claiming that I am attacking these people and spamming me with the  No personal attacks template. Want a personal attack? FUCK YOU, you suck cock. How is that for a personal attack? The User on wikipedia, named All Star is a criminal who is wanted in 20 states for rape of children. There's another personal attack. There you go, and here I go, off to reset my router so that I am assigned a new dynamic IP, and should you decide to block my subnet for a few days again I'll just pop onto an open proxy. Frankly, you should stop being a fucking idiot with your warnings when i'm telling a spammer on wikipedia that his efforts have had a negative effect. Fuck you, your efforts have now had a negative effect, I'm off on a vandal spree using anon proxies for a bit, enjoy.   	2007	False	user	blocked	train
